# ExploratoryDataAnalysis


Purpose:
A company which is active in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists 
among people who successfully pass some courses which conduct by the company. Many people 
signup for their training. Company wants to know which of these candidates are really 
wants to work for the company after training or looking for a new employment because it helps 
to reduce the cost and time as well as the quality of training or planning the courses and 
categorization of candidates. Information related to demographics, education, experience 
are in hands from candidates signup and enrollment.     


Data Context:
This dataset designed to understand the factors that lead a person to leave current job for HR 
research too. By model(s) that uses the current credentials, demographics, experience data you will 
predict the probability of a candidate to look for a new job or will work for the company, as 
well as interpreting affected factors on employee decision.  Although the main objective of this kind of
data is the build predictive model to classify a candidate to find the probability whether the candidate 
will work for them or not, your main goal in this assignment will be to do exploratory data analysis (We have 
learned various concepts of EDA in the class already in the class). During this process you will learn 
more about this data, missing values, outliers, correlations, distributions, filling out missing values 
or removing records, combining features, removing unnecessary features, etc. You will also find other 
issues such as whether the data set is imbalanced and if yes, how to balance it, etc.     
In order to answer the questions, you might need to use your python and EDA knowledge from data camp courses, 
lecture notes, and for some python syntax and libraries you might need to google or use python documentation 
and examples.
